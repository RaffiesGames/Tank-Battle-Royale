# Tank-Battle-Royale

An open world tank battle with simple AI, terrain and advanced control systems in UE4.
Coding and physics done with the help of C++ and Blueprints.

# Concept:
Tanks move across the terrain using it as an advantage to hide from other tank attacks and to fire at the other tanks.
Tanks have finite ammo and Health Points
Last tank standing wins.

# Rules:
Each tank spawns on different spots on the map
All tanks will have same features and ammo to provide a fair and balanced gameplay.
It is a 1v13 Tank Battle Royale. Be the last tank standing to win.
Good Luck!
